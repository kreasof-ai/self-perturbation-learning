These results based on 30K training example from `math-ai/AutoMathText` datasets. The revised quality calculated by negative min-max scaling from negative log-likelihood (min = -1, max = 0). The original calculation from experiment v5 uses different scaling (min = -100, max = 0).

- Text: To simplify the algebraic expression `(3x^2 - 4y^3) / (2x)`, we can follow a few steps: Step 1: Distribute the division symbol by multiplying the expression by the reciprocal of the denominator. The reciprocal of `2x` is `1/(2x)`, so the expression becomes `(3x^2 - 4y^3) * (1/(2x))`. Step 2: Simplify within the parentheses by dividing each term separately. - For the first term, `3x^2`, divide `3x^2` by `2x`. This gives us `(3x^2) / (2x) = (3/2) * (x^2 / x) = (3/2) * x`. - For the second term, `-4y^3`, divide `-4y^3` by `2x`. This gives us `(-4y^3) / (2x) = (-2) * (y^3 / x)`. Step 3: Combine the simplified terms from Step 2. The expression now becomes `(3/2) * x - 2 * (y^3 / x)`. So, the simplified form of the algebraic expression `(3x^2 - 4y^3) / (2x)` is `(3/2) * x - 2 * (y^3 / x)`.

- Text: To simplify the algebraic expression `(3x^2 - 4y^3) / (2x)`, you can divide each term in the numerator by the denominator. First, let's divide `3x^2` by `2x`. Since both terms have a common factor of `x`, we can simplify this expression to `3x`. Next, we divide `-4y^3` by `2x`. We can simplify this expression by dividing each term separately. Dividing `-4` by `2` gives `-2`. Then, dividing `y^3` by `x` gives `y^3/x`. So, the simplified form of `(3x^2 - 4y^3) / (2x)` is `3x - 2y^3/x`.

- Text: Proof that 1 = 2. Let’s start with two equal numbers, \( a = b \). 1. Multiply both sides by \( a \): \( a^2 = ab \). 2. Subtract \( b^2 \) from both sides: \( a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2 \). 3. Factor both sides: \( (a - b)(a + b) = b(a - b) \). 4. Divide both sides by \( (a - b) \): \( a + b = b \). 5. Since \( a = b \), substitute \( b \) for \( a \): \( b + b = b \) → \( 2b = b \). 6. Divide both sides by \( b \): \( 2 = 1 \).

- Text: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May? In the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 = $<<100/2=50>>50. Betty's grandparents gave her 15 * 2 = $<<15*2=30>>30. This means, Betty needs 100 - 50 - 30 - 15 = $<<100-50-30-15=5>>5 more. #### 5
