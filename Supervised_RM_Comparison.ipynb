The reciprocal of `2x` is `1/(2x)`, so the expression becomes `(3x^2 - 4y^3) * (1/(2x))`. Step 2: Simplify within the parentheses by dividing each term separately. - For the first term, `3x^2`, divide `3x^2` by `2x`. This gives us `(3x^2) / (2x) = (3/2) * (x^2 / x) = (3/2) * x`. - For the second term, `-4y^3`, divide `-4y^3` by `2x`. This gives us `(-4y^3) / (2x) = (-2) * (y^3 / x)`. Step 3: Combine the simplified terms from Step 2. The expression now becomes `(3/2) * x - 2 * (y^3 / x)`. So, the simplified form of the algebraic expression `(3x^2 - 4y^3) / (2x)` is `(3/2) * x - 2 * (y^3 / x)`.\",\n",
